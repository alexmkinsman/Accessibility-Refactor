# Code Refactor Starter Code
During this project I practiced the parts of coding that make websites accessible to all who use the internet. I learned to commit my files to github and deploy a website. I now have a fully accessible deployed website with working links and pictures. This will be important for my career because these accessibility standards hold for every website on the internet and affect where a website shows up on a google search.
